Nagios XI Installation  

Installing Nagios XI by running curl https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagiosxi/install.sh | sh 

Install aptitude by running apt-get install aptitude –y 

In my case  it was libdbd-mysql-perl. So, the command becomes: aptitude install libdbd-mysql-perl 

There will be two prompts. The first one will ask to use defaults to which you say ‘n’  

The second one will ask you if you want to install all dependencies to which you say ‘Y’ 

Once this completes, you can run the curl command and install Nagios XI without any issues.
